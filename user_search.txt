A user flow diagram of meal planning app split into 2 Stages. 
Stage 1: The first time the user starts to meal plan. They are asked their food preferences, meal planning preferences and  goals. Once they put in all the info the meal plan is generated and the system suggest the entire meal plan. 
Stage 2: is the second time they user tries to meal plan. They are simply asked whether they want to use the same info as last time and then can generate. If they want to change, they are prompted to choose which thing they want to change and can do so.  Product Manager

Before  spice tempering step there always a oil smoking step.
Spice Tempering is Time or Temperature based control; Temperature set point is +20 of the current temperature when the step is entered else it is  total time is 30sec for any serving scale .
Special case
For oil smoking in case of butter/ghee this entire step will come directly after Preheat.

Create  a flowchart for sauté mode in cooking section, Here the completion criteria of this mode is based on time given by the recipe .
It has setpoint temperature which is set point temperature  =  current temperature + 20c (it is ABF condition).
Saute has 2 phases :
1 phase is 80% of the total time alloted for saute ,where it runs on power mode , the power level given is 6 out of 10 scale  based on the vessel type aluminum is 7 and ss vessel is 6 
Once it reaches 80% of the time the current temperature at phase 1 + 20c is the target temperature for the phase 2 .
In phase 2 it will try to reach the target temperature , once if it reaches it before time , then  temperature control based logic is implemented .
Completion of phase 1 is based on 80% time passed for time given for saute and then in phase 2 it runs till the other 20% time is achieved if it achieves before time then it runs temperature control logic .   Software Engineer

Saute mode 
Divided into two phases ,phase 1 and phase 2 
Phase 1 equals to 80 % completion time 
Phase 2 equals to 20 % completion time
Phase 1 ,Maintain constant power until 80% of RCT time 
ABF for Phase 1 ,previous temperature plus 20-25 c .
If Temperature doesn't reach ABF continue till the 80% time.
If temperature reaches ABF go to temperature control and maintain that temperature for rest of time.
Phase 2 ,Set point is previous temperature plus 20-25 c 
Maintain constant power till completion time 
if temperature reaches target set point go to temperature control and maintain that temperature.A

Draw a flow chart for simmering mode in cooking session , Simmering is performed after add water step for gravy recipes. 
There are two inputs required for the control:
Total time to simmer (given by the RCT)
Current Vessel Temperature (center probe) (used for burn detection).
Simmering is based on the REEP {Runtime Estimated Exponential Power} equation which gives  power level as output to the  Control Steps
First get the total simmer time from RCT
Calculate the a, b, c exponential equation constants
let,
RC = REEP Constant (Derived from RCT inputs)
p1 = 18, complete max power chosen
p2 = 14, power chosen at the end of initial stage 1 boiling
p3 = 7, constant power required to simmer at infinite time, estimated by tests
c = p3 (constant power required to simmer at infinite time, estimated by tests)
a = (p2 - c) (the highest power chosen at the end of initial stage 1 boiling, estimated by tests)
RF is reep factor 
RF = (ln((p2-c)/a)) /(-10% of total  time for simmering)
A[power Output of REEP] --> B["a * (e^(-RF*te)) + c"]
if vessel == ss
power = power - 1
if power > 12: power = 12
if power < 6: power = 6
else power = power
if vessel == large vessel
if power > 14: power = 14
if power < 7: power = 7
else power = power Software Engineer
