A user flow diagram of meal planning app split into 2 Stages. 
Stage 1: The first time the user starts to meal plan. They are asked their food preferences, meal planning preferences and  goals. Once they put in all the info the meal plan is generated and the system suggest the entire meal plan. 
Stage 2: is the second time they user tries to meal plan. They are simply asked whether they want to use the same info as last time and then can generate. If they want to change, they are prompted to choose which thing they want to change and can do so.  Product Manager

Before  spice tempering step there always a oil smoking step.
Spice Tempering is Time or Temperature based control; Temperature set point is +20 of the current temperature when the step is entered else it is  total time is 30sec for any serving scale .
Special case
For oil smoking in case of butter/ghee this entire step will come directly after Preheat.

Create  a flowchart for sauté mode in cooking section, Here the completion criteria of this mode is based on time given by the recipe .
It has setpoint temperature which is set point temperature  =  current temperature + 20c (it is ABF condition).
Saute has 2 phases :
1 phase is 80% of the total time alloted for saute ,where it runs on power mode , the power level given is 6 out of 10 scale  based on the vessel type aluminum is 7 and ss vessel is 6 
Once it reaches 80% of the time the current temperature at phase 1 + 20c is the target temperature for the phase 2 .
In phase 2 it will try to reach the target temperature , once if it reaches it before time , then  temperature control based logic is implemented .
Completion of phase 1 is based on 80% time passed for time given for saute and then in phase 2 it runs till the other 20% time is achieved if it achieves before time then it runs temperature control logic .   Software Engineer
